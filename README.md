# An Amazon clone is a replica of Amazonâ€™s e-commerce platform, designed to mimic its core functionality and user experience. Such a clone includes features like product listings with images and details, a search bar for easy product discovery, and categorization of items. It typically supports user accounts, shopping carts, and secure checkout options. The platform might integrate reviews, ratings, and recommendations to enhance the shopping experience. An admin panel is often included for managing products, orders, and users.

The goal is to recreate the essential features of Amazon to provide a familiar, robust online shopping environment that can be customized based on business needs.
